Personal Guix Packge definitions. One day I'll try to polish them up
and add them to Guix.

The best stuff is of course the [[file:jrn/packages/j.scm][J]] stuff. Building base J spits out a
custom ~profile.ijs~ file that points addons to
~~/.guix-profile/share/j/addons/~. This allows addon scripts to be
added without depending on J. Granted, it also doesn't seem like the
right solution, but it works. The addons I know link to shared objects
have been modified to link to the appropriate libraries in the gnu
store (like image addons, gl, tar, fftw, etc), though I'm sure I've
missed a few.

Getting a hold of these package definitions may be done through
linking here in your ~~/.config/guix/channels.scm~ file:

#+begin_src scheme :session
`(,(channel
    (name 'jrn)
    (url "https://github.com/jitwit/guix-recipes")
    (branch "a"))
  ,@%default-channels)
#+end_src
