Personal Guix Packge definitions. One day I'll try to polish them up
and add them to Guix.

The best stuff is of course the [[file:jrn/packages/j.scm][J]] stuff, including J, jqt, and most(?)
addons. Building base J spits out a custom ~profile.ijs~ file that
points addons to ~$HOME/.guix-profile/share/j/addons/~. This allows
addon scripts to be added without depending on J. I don't think this
is the right solution, but it works for me for now. The addons that I
know link to shared objects have been modified to link to the
appropriate libraries in the gnu store (like image addons, gl, tar,
fftw, etc), though I'm sure I've missed a few.

Getting a hold of these package definitions may be done by linking
here in your ~$HOME/.config/guix/channels.scm~ file:

#+begin_src scheme :session
`(,(channel
    (name 'jrn)
    (url "https://github.com/jitwit/guix-recipes")
    (branch "a"))
  ,@%default-channels)
#+end_src
